# Navigating-YouTube-Trends-for-Data-Science-AI
The task was to create a ranking model that could help identify trends in various video categories and recommend three best videos to promote an E-learning platform focused on Data & AI skills ðŸ§ 

The datasets **Videos Stats** and **Comments** were modified from the [original source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/advaypatil/youtube-statistics/data) on Kaggle.

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of video engagement metrics across various categories, with a focus on identifying trends that drive audience interaction. The analysis began with data cleaning steps, including the removal of missing values and duplicates, followed by an exploration of data distributions and the handling of outliers. We observed significant skewness in the distribution of likes, comments, and views, which informed our decision to use median values for subsequent analyses.

## What was done:
- **Video Classification**: I streamlined the initial 41 video categories into broader, more manageable groups to improve clarity. This regrouping ensured all the videos are classified according to their main topic and decreased the number of groups to 14.
- **Creation of Video Engagement Index**: I developed an engagement index to assess the popularity of videos by combining likes, comments, and views. This index was instrumental in identifying the most common words in the titles of highly popular videos within each category, revealing content trends that resonate with audiences.
- **Sentiment Analysis of Comments**: Employing a logistic regression model, I conducted a sentiment analysis of video comments, classifying them into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. This analysis offered a detailed understanding of viewer reactions and highlighted the emotional impact of different video categories.
- **Overall Sentiment Score Calculation**: To reflect the influence of audience engagement, I developed an overall sentiment score for each video. This score was derived from the sentiment predictions of individual comments, with greater weight assigned to comments that received more likes, indicating a higher impact on the overall perception of the video.
- **Analysis of Common Positive & Negative Words**: We identified the most frequently occurring positive and negative words in comments for each video category. This analysis provided insights into the sentiment trends and key themes that are prevalent in viewer feedback across various categories.
- **Video Ranking Model Development**: A robust ranking model was created using CatBoost Ranker, focusing on a relevance parameter. This parameter was a composite index derived from engagement metrics and the overall sentiment score. The model effectively ranks videos in each category based on their engagement and sentiment scores, ensuring the identification of top-performing content.

## What was revealed:
- **Engagement Trends**: The analysis revealed that **tutorials & how to, entertainment, and food** videos are the most engaging, with the highest median likes and comments. Videos featuring **animals** garnered the most views, while **media & news** videos attracted the highest number of comments.
- **Content Themes**: Popular video titles often included specific keywords relevant to their category. For instance, "Gordon Ramsay" and "mukbang" were frequent in the food category, while terms like "machine learning" and "Python" were prevalent in data & AI skills videos. Content creators are advised to focus on these trending topics to maximize engagement.
- **Sentiment Insights**: Positive comments dominated the dataset, especially in categories like **tutorials & how to and entertainment**. Conversely, **media & news** videos were predominantly met with negative feedback, likely due to the nature of the content.
- **Engagement-Weighted Sentiment Analysis**: By weighting comments based on their like counts, we ensured that comments with higher engagement had a greater impact on the overall video sentiment score. This methodology provided a more accurate reflection of the audience's sentiment towards each video.
- **Top Video Recommendations**: Our ranking model has identified high-performing videos in the data & AI skills category, highlighting the demand for educational content. Notably, videos centered around machine learning for beginners are particularly popular (which was found during the videos' titles analysis and supported by model's predictions).My final recommendations include two videos, that feature machine learning for beginners and one video featuring AI skills from Google engineer. I recommend emphasizing the creation and promotion of content that is not only relevant but also reflects the latest advancements and trends in the field. Ensuring that content is fresh and aligned with current industry practices will help in maintaining viewer interest and authority in fast-evolving areas like artificial intelligence.
